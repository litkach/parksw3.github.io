Trajectory of the system by starting near an equilibrium point. Following initial conditions were used

$$
(N_1(0), N_2(0), N_3(0). N_4(0)) = (0.1, 0.4, 0.1 - \epsilon, 0.4 + \epsilon)
$$

by varying $\epsilon$. Red dashed lines represent the set of all following equilibrium points:

$$
(N_1^\ast, N_2^\ast, N_3^\ast, N_4^\ast) = (x, -x+1/2, x, -x+1/2).
$$

For all simulations, the following parameters were used: $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (0.3, 1, 1.7).$ Refer to this [post](https://parksw3.github.io/2016/10/25/competition-model/) for further details about the model. All code used to generate this figure can be found [here](https://github.com/parksw3/three_competitors_model/blob/master/R/epsilonPlot.R).
