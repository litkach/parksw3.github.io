title: "Period of four competitors model"
---

1000 initial states were sampled using [Latin Hypercube Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling). Period of each limit cycle was calculated for each run and was plotted against its initial condition:

$$
N_1 N_2 N_3 N_4/(N_1 + N_2 + N_3 + N_4)^4
$$

For all simulations, the following parameters were used: $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = (0.3, 1, 1.7).$ Refer to this [post](https://parksw3.github.io/2016/10/25/competition-model/) for further details about the model.
