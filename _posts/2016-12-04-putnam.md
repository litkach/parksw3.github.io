Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for every real polynomial $P(x)$ of degree has a root in the interval $[0,1]$,

$$
\int_0^1 \left|P(x) \right|dx \leq C \max\limits_{x \in [0, 1]} \left|P(x) \right|.
$$

Yesterday, I wrote the [Putnam competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lowell_Putnam_Mathematical_Competition), and this was one of the problems on the exam. This question really stood out to me because it seemed like a simple optimization problem (of course, finding an analytical solution is difficult). It basically asks us to maximize

$$
\int_0^1 \left|P(x) \right|dx/\max\limits_{x \in [0, 1]} \left|P(x) \right|.
$$

So I thought this would be a fun coding excercise.

To solve the problem, we have to first define a third degree polynomial with at least one root in the interval $[0,1]$:

$$
P(x) = k (x - a)(x^2 + bx + c)
$$

where $0 \leq a \leq 1$, and $b$, $c$, and $k$ can be any real numbers. Since we're taking the absolute value of the polynomial and comparing the maximum value with the integral, we can just let $k = 1$. Furthermore, in order to ensure that $a$ stays within the boundary, we can use [logit scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit):

```r
absP <- function(x, pars){
    with(as.list(pars),{
        if(exists("logit.a")) a <- plogis(logit.a)
        return(abs((x - a) * (x^2 + b * x + c)))
    })
}
```

By doing this, `absP` function can take either `a` or `logit.a`, and the latter parameterization guarantees that the polynomial will always have at least one root in the interval $[0, 1]$.

Now, we have to define the objective function. Since the question requires us to integrate the absolute value of the polynomial, We can use `integrate` function to integrate the polynomial numerically:

```r
subdiv <- 10000
interval <- c(0, 1)
q <- seq(interval[1], interval[2], length.out = subdiv)

objfun <- function(pars) {
    area <- integrate(absP, lower = interval[1], upper = interval[2], subdivisions = subdiv, pars = pars)
    area <- area$value
    height <- max(absP(q, pars))
    
    return(area/height)
}
```

We can now use `optim` to find the maximum value.

```r
res <- optim(par = c(logit.a = 1, b = 1, c = 1),
    fn = objfun,
    control = list(fnscale = -1, maxit = 1e7)
)
print(res)
```

```
## $par
##     logit.a           b           c 
##  1.86232932 -0.01423672  0.18124922 
## 
## $value
## [1] 0.7835679
## 
## $counts
## function gradient 
##      739       NA 
## 
## $convergence
## [1] 0
## 
## $message
## NULL
```

This gives us a decent looking answer but it's still far from the [actual answer](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/community/c7h1349022_putnam_2016_a6) so it's probably getting stuck in local minima. Usually, it's possible to get around this issue by either running optimization from different starting points or using different optimization methods. So I decided to try running `optim` with different starting values sampled with [Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling).

First, let's load some packages:

```r
library(ggplot2); theme_set(theme_bw())
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr) ## for %T>%
library(tibble)
```

For simplicity, we can just use same ranges for all parameters and assume that they are uniformly distributed. Then, LHS can be done easily with `replicate` function. So I tried running `optim` with 100 different starting parameters.

```r
## LHS
range <- c(-2, 2)
samp <- seq(range[1], range[2], length.out = 100)
samp.df <- replicate(3, sample(samp)) %>%
    as_tibble %>%
    setNames(c("logit.a", "b", "c"))

## running optimization
resList <- samp.df %>% apply(1, function(pars){
    optim(par = pars, fn = objfun, control = list(fnscale = -1, maxit = 1e5))
})

## summarizing the result
sL <- resList %>%
    lapply(function(x){
        c(x$par, value = x$value) %>% 
            t %>%
            as_tibble
    }) %>%
    bind_rows(.id = "run")
```

Now, we can just take the maximum value across all runs:

```r
maxres <- sL %>% filter(value == max(value)) %T>% print
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 Ã— 5
##     run  logit.a            b         c     value
##   <chr>    <dbl>        <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>
## 1    68 23.48164 3.542066e-05 0.2500177 0.8333333
```

Finally, we get an answer, $5/6$, that is consistent with the analytical solution!

```r
maxdf <- tibble(x = q, y = absP(q, maxres[2:4]))

ggplot(maxdf %>% add_row(x = 0, y = 0), aes(x, y)) +
    geom_polygon(alpha = 0.1, col = "black") +
    coord_fixed() +
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 1.1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 0.3)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.25, col = "red", lty = 2) +
    annotate("text", x = 0.96, y = 0.17, label = "P(x)==(1-x)(x^2 + 0.25)", parse = TRUE) +
    annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.25, label = "max value: 0.25", hjust = -0.1, vjust = -1.2)
```
