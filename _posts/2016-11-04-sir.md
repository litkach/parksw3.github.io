title: "Pseudo-SIR model"
---

I think I just came up with an interesting way of approximating an SIR model (it's likely that someone else has already done this but I didn't look into it deeply enough).

For those who are not familiar, an [SIR model](http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model) is simply a set of differential equations that describes how people get infected:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta S I/N,\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I/N - \gamma I,\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I,\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $S$, $I$, and $R$ represent the number of individuals that are susceptible, infected (and infectious), and recovered (or removed) respectively. Although it looks fairly simple, it can't be solved analytically. There is a very nice approximation done by [Kermack and McKendrick](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsa/115/772/700.full.pdf) but the approximation is rather limited.

Anyways, I've been staring at the SIR model for a while recently for many reasons, and I wanted to know if I can come up with a way of approximating it. One of the first things I did was to normalize the equation $(S + I + R = 1)$ and express everything in terms of $I$. After a bit of algebra, we get

$$
I'(t) = (\beta - \gamma) I - \beta I^2 - \beta \gamma I \left(\int_0^t I(a) da - I(0) \right).
$$

Now that I think about it, it seems a bit ridiculous how I jumped to the conclusion from here but I somehow thought that it would be a good idea to approximate the SIR model using a [logistic equation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticEquation.html) with carrying capacity monotonically decreasing towards $0$ as $t \to \infty$:

$$
I(t) = \frac{e^{-r_2 f(t)}}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{I(0)} - 1 \right) e^{- r_1 t}},
$$

where $r_1, r_2$ are positive real numbers and $f(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $t$. In fact, this somewhat behaves like an SIR model. If we let $f(t) = t$ and differentiate, we get

$$
I'(t) = r_1 \left(\frac{1}{I(0)} -1\right) I^2 e^{-(r_1 - r_2) t} - r_2 I.
$$

If we define $S(t) = \left(\frac{1}{I(0)} -1\right) I e^{-(r_1 - r_2) t}$, $r_1 = \beta$ and $r_2 = \gamma$, we get

$$
I'(t) = \beta S I - \gamma I.
$$

This is my "pseudo-SIR model". For this approximation to work, I think the restriction is $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty} S(t) = 0$ but I need to look into this more carefully. Anyways, how well does this approximation work? Here's a comparison using $(\beta, \gamma, I(0)) = (0.3, 0.05, 0.01)$.

It doesn't do so well. The difference between the approximated curve (black line) and the actual prevalence trajectory (red dashed line) is large.

But here is the interesting part. If we fit an SIR model to the pseudo-SIR model using maximum likelihood estimation, we get almost identical looking curves: 

![Figure 2]({{ site.url }}/assets/2016-11-04-sir/goodfit2.png)

where the parameters are $(\beta, \gamma, N, I(0)) \approx (0.355, 0.536, 0.515, 0.01)$. I've tried fitting an SIR model to pseudo SIR model over some range of parameters and it seems to work fairly well. So the real question is how do we go from one model to another model analytically?

I think going from SIR model to pseudo-SIR model should be easy because most of the important values (peak $I$, peak time, second derivative at the peak, etc.) can be calculated analytically. However, this depends on the knowledge of the value of $I$ at the peak, which requires a numerical simulation and I want to know if I can do it without any simulations. Going from pseudo-SIR to SIR model seems a lot harder even with numerical simulations.

Now, I should probably stop writing and go work on an assignment (or this if I get bored)...
