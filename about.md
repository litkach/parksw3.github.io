Who am I?
----

My name is Sang Woo Park and I'm an undergraduate student studying mathematics and statistics at McMaster University.

I enjoy solving various math problems and I'm interested in understanding biological mechanisms using mathematical, statistical, and computational tools. My research primarily focuses on infectious disease modelling and evolutionary ecology.

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) most of the time but I try to code with [Aheui](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Aheui) occasionally.

This is my personal blog and I will be writing about any math and R related contents that I find interesting.
