Who am I?
----

My name is Sang Woo Park and I'm an undergraduate student studying mathematics and statistics at McMaster University.

I enjoy solving various math problems, and I'm interested in understanding biology using mathematical tools. My research mostly focuses on infectious disease modeling and evolutionary biology.

I use R most of the time, but I try to code with [Aheui](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Aheui) occasionally.

This is my personal blog and I will be writing about any math and R related contents that I find interesting.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is based on [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/).
